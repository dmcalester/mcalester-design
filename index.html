      <p>So this is my new site. I haven’t made a personal site in years. I always get stuck. I’m going to get stuck again, but two things are rattling around in my head. First, in my hubris, I think I have interesting things to say and need a place to put them. So they’re going here. The second is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law">Gall’s Law</a>. I discovered this one on my time working on the AstroUX Design System. Gall’s Law states: <blockquote>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved tome a simple system that worked. A complex syste designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.</blockquote>While I have complex ideas for this site, I can’t start there. So I’m starting as simple as possible – just like the very first web page I ever wrote back in … I don’t know 1993, maybe ’94; back before CSS and JavaScript were even concepts; back before I even had a PPP internet connection required for using a GUI browser like Mosaic; back before there were even mobile devices capable of displaying web pages – let alone responsive design, this sucker is going to be one HTML page rendered in whatever default state your browser is going to show it in.<a href="#article-2025-12-03--footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>That’s it. That’s the site.</p>
      <p>For now.</p>
